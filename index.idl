The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a lesser known
government office meant to protect consumers.
Created in the wake of the financial crisis, the bureau has been collecting
consumers' complaints since 2011,
and requiring that the companies provide a timely response to the complaint. All of these records
are stored in a database and are [link text:"available to the public" href:"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/" /].

The records are anonymized, but many still contain the
consumer's complaint in their own words, or the
"consumer complaint narrative", as the CFPB calls it. The quotes below
are randomly taken from the database.

[/aside]

The number of complaints submitted each month has been steadily increasing since the
bureau's creation. There were over 20,000 submitted in January 2017 alone.

This trend may be optimistic. In February [link text:"Bloomberg reported" href:"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-08/the-cfpb-keeps-a-database-that-banks-can-t-wait-to-wipe" /]
that the CFPB is "a prime target for a Trump administration that has vowed to rewrite
Obama-era financial rules and has suggested it will change the consumer bureauâ€™s approach to policing financial markets."

Given that, it seemed an opportune time to dig into the database
and see what I could learn.

## The Biggest Offenders

The most obvious question to ask is "What is the most complained about company in America?" That honor goes to
the **Bank of America**, and it isn't even close. Bank of America has had 12,415 more complaints levied against
it than the next runner up, Wells Fargo.

The table below shows the top ten most-complained-about companies. Most of them are large financial institutions, and this makes
sense: many of the complaints deal with financial matters such as bank accounts, credit cards, mortgages, loans, credit
reports, and debt collection. These are the exactly types of things that the bureau was set up to deal with.

[ComplaintsTable data:complaints /]

One of the major services that the CFPB provides is requiring companies to respond to complaints within a certain
timeframe (typically about two weeks). And it actually does work. About 97% of the registered complaints
are marked as having received a response in a timely manner. This is important: if you spend some time looking
at the consumer narratives, you'll notice that it isn't uncommon for people to be confused about a debt, or
not understand why collectors are after them. Some people attempt to contact the company claiming a debt,
but turn to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after receiving no response.

Whether or not consumers are happy
with the responses that they get is harder to say with the given data. In the vast majority of cases, about 93%,
the company chooses to provide no public response, or the only public response is to admit no
wrongdoing ("Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law").

## The Debt Collectors

After reading the text of many of the complaints, it became apparent that
many of the complaints were from confused or scared consumers being pursued by debt collectors.

In many cases they had no idea what the debt was about,
or claimed the collectors were mistakenly pursuing them for a debt belonging to someone else.
In fact, **Debt is not mine** is one of the most common issues. There are about 35,000 complaints in the
database with this tag. There are also more than 15,000 complaints that the **Debt was paid**.

By looking at the companies associated with those complaints, we can generate a list of the most
incompetent (or malicious) debt collection agencies.

[Table data:`wrongDebt.slice(0,5)` className:"wrong-debt" /]

The same companies that are wrongly pursuing debts are
also the same ones that try to collect on debts that have already
been paid. Notice the repeat offenders in the following table.

possibly the worst company in America. Note, I didn't handpick any of these quotes,
they are randomly selected from the complaint database.

In June of last year John Oliver [link text:"called out Encore Capital Group" href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxUAntt1z2c" /] during a segment
on debt buyers. The number of complaints against these debt collectors supports his position.

## Conclusion

This is just a rudimentary analysis. There may be many more things to learn by more closely analyzing the data contained in the
CFPB's database. For example, each complaint has a zip code associated with it. Looking at where complaints are coming from
geographically might reveal something about how companies operate in different parts of the country.

I look forward to seeing other people look at this data, and hope that this organization will continue to exist, even under the
current administration.
